**Note**: This generator is in alpha state, so any changes to the algorithm may occur until v1 is released. Specific seed will most likely not work reliably until then.

## Project
The projects consists of multiple parts:
- *SVG combiner*, combines multiple `.svg` files into one
- *Generator*, rulebook for how image should be combined (generating by generator version and seed)
- *Webservice*, allows for generating images rapidly, and in extesnion, from anywhere.

## Hack
> Can I hack it?

Yes. Although this project right now generates a person with clothes, there is nothing stopping you from changing what is being generated. It is a bit bulky, but with some effort you could make your own generator.

In essence, this is a glorified SVG-combiner.

## Roadmap
Nothing is set in stone. This is a passion project at best, and I will work on what I want when I feel like it. But in general, there are a few things I want to besides improving the codebase:
- [ ] Allow for custom generator rules in simple JSON format. I would be so cool if any generation logic was a *simple* document, making it very hackable.
   - [x] Parts generator
   - [ ] Custom rules (disallow certain combinations, etc.)
- [ ] Add more clothes.
- [ ] `//todo: add more`
